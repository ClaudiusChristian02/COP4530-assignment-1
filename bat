Notably, several listings that have graced Forbes annual tally of Most 
Expensive Homes For Sale in past years have found buyers. In December, 
Tommy Hilfiger co-founder Joel Horowitz reportedly sold Tranquility, the 
210-acre Lake Tahoe estate hed initially listed in 2006 for $100 million. 
Reported sale price: $48 million. Also this year, billionaire David Geffen 
bought Courtney Sale Ross 7,500-square-foot Georgica Pond estate for $50 
million (List price: $75 million).

Other properties have disappeared from the list simply by chopping prices. 
Walton Ranch, the 1,848-acre Jackson Hole, Wyo. spread once listed at $100 
million, is now asking a mere $48.7 million. In Sagaponack, N.Y., a 
33-acre spread once priced at $65 million is asking $59 million.

Still others ultra-expensive homes are off the market completely. 
Versailles, the gaudy mansion made famous in the documentary The Queen of 
Versailles, once listed for $90 million finished or $65 million 
unfinished. Homeowners David and Jackie Siegel are now back at 
construction, and showed off their progress on ABC News last fall.

At least one property popped off the market without a word. In early July, 
the listing for Steve Cohens $98 million penthouse at One Beacon Court, 
Manhattans Bloomberg Tower, disappeared. Agents Deborah Grubman and David 
Dubin did not respond to Forbes inquiry regarding whether the property has 
sold. Other sources tell us the answer is no. Instead, Cohens trophy 
homewhich once sought $115 millionwas simply overpriced.
